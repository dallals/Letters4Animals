                <h3>Animal Cruelty and Factory Farming</h3>
                <p>
                    Animals raised for food in the United States endure unspeakable suffering. The days of the family farm are over, and more than 97% of the meat and dairy Americans consume comes from factory farms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Factory farming is the term used to describe the industrial process of breeding, raising, and slaughtering animals for human consumption on a mass-production scale, where profit and efficiency drive the industry practices and there is little to no regard for the welfare of the animal. Animals in the factory farming system are treated as commodities being exploited for profit with few laws to protect them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Many people don’t realize just how brutal and cruel the animal agriculture industries are, as those industries spend millions of dollars to hide the reality of what happens inside their walls. They also spend huge amounts of money on advertising campaigns to deceive the public about how the industry treats its animals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Factory farms pack animals into spaces so tight that most can barely move. Many have no access to the outdoors, spending their lives on open warehouse floors, or in cages or pens without the room to engage in their natural behaviors. These confined animals experience severe physical and mental distress.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the realities of today’s animal agriculture industries:

                                In the first six months of a newborn calf’s life, they will almost always have one or more extremely painful procedures performed on them without anesthesia: hot-iron branding, castration, dehorning, and tail-docking. The pain caused by these procedures can last for months as they heal. <br><br>
                                Between the ages of six months and one year, beef cows are sent to live their last few months in feedlots with hundreds or even thousands of others. Without pasture and often without shelter, the cows must stand in their own waste and sometimes in mud and ice. To increase their weight, they are fed an unnatural grain diet that is very hard on their bodies, causing illness, pain, and sometimes death.<br><br>
                                When the cows are transported for slaughter, they are generally crammed onto trucks where they might stand for several days without any water, food, or the ability to move or rest. The cattle are transported this way regardless of the weather, so it is not uncommon for cows to collapse from the heat or even freeze to the side of the trucks in the bitter cold.<br><br>
                                When the truck finally arrives at the slaughterhouse, some of the cows are too sick or injured to walk. They call these cows “downers” and will often tie ropes or chains around their legs to drag them off the truck. The cows that can walk on their own are often beaten or prodded with an electric shock to move them off the truck.<br><br>
                                After they are unloaded, cows are prodded into the slaughterhouse and shot in the head with a captive-bolt gun meant to stun them unconscious prior to being hoisted up by their back legs in preparation for slaughter by having their throats cut. Frequently the “stunning” is not successful, and as a result, many cows are fully conscious and struggling while their leg bones are being broken as they are hung upside down, and worse yet, they are still conscious as their throats are cut.<br>

                                Virtually all dairy calves are stolen from their mothers within hours of birth in order to maximize profit. The mother cow can bellow for days, traumatized by the loss of her calf.<br>
                                Many male calves are slaughtered immediately, while others are sold off to be raised for veal, kept in tiny individual stalls and chained by the neck on a 2 or 3 foot tether for 18 to 20 weeks before they are slaughtered. The veal industry would not exist without the dairy industry.<br><br>
                                The female calves typically spend the first 2 to 3 months of life confined in lonely hutches deprived of the mother and the milk they instinctively yearn for. <br><br>
                                Over 90% of U.S. dairy cows are confined primarily indoors, with more than 60% tethered by the neck inside barren stalls, unable to perform the most basic behaviors essential to their well-being. Some spend their entire lives standing on concrete floors; others are confined to massive crowded lots, where they are forced to live amid their own waste.<br><br>
                                To have dairy cows produce a maximum yield of milk, they are artificially and forcibly inseminated year after year. Pure and simple, this is rape.<br><br>
                                Through genetic manipulation and use of hormones and antibiotics, cows in the dairy industry produce anywhere from 3 to 10 times more milk than nature intended them to. Carrying this excessive quantity of milk causes pain for the cows and robs them of calcium and other nutrients. It also requires that the cows be milked more often, which in turn increases the risk of the painful and potentially fatal udder infection called mastitis. <br><br>
                                Trapped in a cycle of forced impregnation, perpetual lactation, and near constant confinement, dairy cows’ overworked bodies begin producing less milk at 4 to 5 years of age, at which point they are sent to slaughter. Of the 9 million dairy cows in the United States, 3 million are slaughtered each year at only a fraction of their natural lifespan.<br>

                                About 8.5 billion chickens are killed for their meat every year.<br>
                                In an effort to maximize profits, on today’s factory farms, chickens are bred to be much larger than nature ever intended. They grow to be so heavy that their bones cannot support their weight. It is constantly painful for the chickens to stand, and their legs often break. <br><br>
                                The chickens are raised in such stressful and overcrowded conditions that they become aggressive. To prevent them from killing each other, their beaks and toes are cut off without anesthesia. Some cannot eat after being “debeaked” and starve to death. This beak amputation causes the bird severe pain that can last for weeks.<br><br>
                                They are forced to live in large sheds sometimes containing as many as 20,000 chickens, crammed together with little space to move. They live in their own waste, causing high ammonia levels that result in painful irritation and burning in their eyes, throats, and skin.<br>
                            </p>

                        </div>

                                Chicks bred for egg production are born in large incubators and will never see their mothers.<br><br>
                                Shortly after birth, male chicks, who cannot produce eggs, are simply killed by being ground up alive, suffocated by being tossed in large garbage bins, or gassed. More than 100 million male chicks are killed by the egg industry in the United States each year.<br><br>
                                As with chickens raised for meat, the female egg-laying chicks begin their tortured lives by having a portion of their beaks burned or sliced off without anesthesia. This “debeaking” causes the bird severe pain that can last for weeks. It is done so they won’t hurt or kill each other, as their behavior often turns aggressive due to the relentless stress of the intense confinement they face in battery cages.<br><br>
                                Annually, 300 million egg producing chickens are packed in small wire battery cages, usually with less than half a square foot of floor space per bird, stacked in rows in long windowless sheds. These rows of cages are often stacked on top of each other, which allows urine and feces to fall from the birds in the higher cages onto those below. Because of these terrible living conditions, millions of egg-laying hens die during production each year and are often left to rot in the same cages with living birds.<br><br>
                                When the hen’s egg production slows down after about 2 years, they are no longer profitable for factory farms, so they are sent to slaughter. By the time these “spent” hens are removed for low production, their skeletons are so fragile that many suffer broken bones during catching or transport.<br><br>
                                Both chickens raised for meat and those raised for eggs meet the same violent death at the slaughterhouse. While totally conscious, they are shackled and hung upside down, electrocuted or scalded to death, and their throats cut. The electrocution process is sometimes not effective, and those chickens end up having their throats cut while still conscious.<br>
                                All birds, including chickens raised for meat, egg-laying hens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and others are excluded from federal animal protection laws.

                                Mother pigs can spend their entire lives in a gestation crate, a metal cage that is so confining that she cannot even turn around. They are repeatedly impregnated until their bodies give out, at which time they are sent to slaughter. Their piglets are only allowed to nurse for 2 to 4 weeks, which is about a quarter of the time nature intended them to nurse. This is done so the mother can quickly be impregnated again. Many of the piglets who are weaned prematurely die of stress and disease.<br><br>
                                When the piglets are removed from their mother, they are subjected to painful mutilations: tail docking, teeth clipped with pliers, and castration, all without any anesthesia. They then placed in large windowless sheds without fresh air, sunlight, or outdoor access. Their waste piles up in these sheds, so they are living with high levels of ammonia resulting in painful irritation and burning in their eyes, throats, and skin. These extremely crowded, filthy sheds or pens are where the pig will spend the rest of its life until it is sent to be slaughtered.<br><br>
                                As with other farmed animals, pigs are packed into trucks with little room to move for the journey to the slaughterhouse, which can be anywhere from a few hours to a few days. They are provided no food or water during transport, and it is done in all extremes of weather. Many of these pigs will die of heat exhaustion during summer or arrive frozen to the inside of the transport truck in winter.<br><br>
                                Like cows, pigs are supposed to be stunned unconscious before slaughter, but it doesn’t always work, so some pigs are still conscious when they are dumped into scalding-hot water, which is intended to remove their hair and soften their skin.<br>

                                “Humane Meat” • “Organic” • “Free-Range” • “Cage-Free”
                                Don’t be fooled by products with any of these labels. While it is true that a “free-range” or “cage-free” hen may have more room to move, they are still generally raised in environments just as filthy and stressful as those raised without the “feel good” labels.<br><br>
                                Keep in mind these labels do not have any bearing on the horrible and mutilating procedures done to farmed animals without anesthesia, including branding, dehorning, tail-docking, castration, and debeaking. These labels also have no bearing on the horror these animals experience during transport to slaughter or the slaughter process.<br><br>
                                Don’t be fooled: “Humane Meat” and other feel-good labels are nothing more than marketing tools to deceive consumers into thinking that the animals were raised humanely. Nothing could be farther from the truth. There is no way to humanely kill an animal that does not want to die. <br>

                <h3>Global Warming and Factory Farming</h3>
                <p>
                    Animal agriculture has very harmful effects on climate change. Animals raised for food eat crops that require abundant amounts of water, produce methane-spewing and water-polluting manure, and cause the conversion of biologically rich forests to grazing lands. A vegan diet, on the other hand, is much more climate friendly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A Loma Linda University study that found that vegans have the smallest carbon footprint, creating nearly 42 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than meat eaters and nearly 14 percent fewer than vegetarians.

                                Operations that grow cows and other animals for food require vast amounts of land for grazing and storing waste. This inevitably causes destruction of greenhouse gas‒trapping forests, which are so important in limiting the effects of climate change. <br><br>

                                In Brazil, the world’s largest beef exporter, three-quarters of Amazon rain forest chopped down and burned since 2000 was for cattle grazing. It is estimated that 289,000 square miles of rain forest have been felled across all the Amazonian countries since 1978. Decomposing vegetation actually releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, a double whammy for climate change.<br><br>

                                And it takes a lot more land to feed people with meat compared with plants. One acre used for cattle feeds only 180 people, while an acre of soybeans feeds over 3,000 people.<br><br>

                                Animals, particularly cows, eat a lot of water-hogging corn, alfalfa, and hay. States like California use vast amounts of carbon-intensive energy to move water to farms and population centers.<br>
                                Shockingly, more than half of all water used in the United States goes to animal agriculture. Why? The plants that farm animals eat consume more than 20 million acre-feet of water per year in California.<br><br>
                                A one-pound steak requires 1,850 gallons of water, while one pound of wheat needs just 171 gallons to grow. And “a one-third-pound burger requires 660 gallons of water to be produced,” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.<br><br>
                                Beef requires 48 times more water to produce than vegetables, while pork needs 19 times more water, and chicken 14 times more water. The effects of animal agriculture are particularly pronounced in areas with prolonged drought.<br><br>

                                It is an undeniable fact that animals create a lot of waste. In fact, animals in factory farms produce three times more waste than humans, or 500 million tons of waste every year in the United States. One dairy cow can produce 120 pounds of manure a day.<br><br>
                                Most animal waste is stored in manure lagoons, which pollute water and air. Manure from farm animals produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is even more potent than carbon dioxide.<br><br>
                            </p>

                        </div>

                                Factory farming of animals produces a significant amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. In fact, nearly one-fifth of human-related greenhouse gases come from animal agriculture, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.<br><br>
                                Incredibly, a one-gallon carton of milk creates about the same amount of pollution as a gallon of gasoline—17 pounds of CO2 for milk versus 20 pounds of CO2 for gasoline. For comparison, one pound of beef produces 12 pounds of CO2, while a pound of tofu and tomatoes each produce less than one pound of CO2.<br><br>
                                We hear about the benefits of eating locally grown foods and driving a hybrid car. But going vegetarian, even one day per week, is better for the planet than driving a hybrid car or eating solely local. Additionally, “if every American skipped one meal of chicken per week and substituted with vegetables and grains … carbon dioxide savings would be the same as taking half a million cars off U.S. roads,” the Environmental Defense Fund reported.<br><br>
                                Clearly, by far, the best choice for the planet is to eat nutritious plants.<br>

                <h3>Animals In Entertainment</h3>
                <p>
                    Humans have used animals for entertainment for thousands of years. Many of the brutal entertainments that were common in the past, such as bear-baiting, a blood sport involving the tormenting (baiting) of bears, have today been recognized as cruel. Unfortunately, many uses of animals  for human entertainment are still carried out and considered completely acceptable. The animals caught up in circuses, zoos, aquariums,  horse-racing, pony rides for children, acting in movies, and so on, are said to be “cared for”, yet they lead confined,  unnatural,  monotony-filled lives, and often suffer brutal cruelty.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are minimal state and federal protections for animals used in entertainment. As Born Free (<a href="www.bornfreeusa.org">www.bornfreeusa.org</a>) states on its website,” Many of the animals used for human amusement are not even covered by the Federal Animal Welfare Act.”  In addition, this Act is limited in its protection, and in its enforcement.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Forcing animals to perform against their will for human entertainment is not only inherently cruel, but, as you can read below, involves many layers of desperation and pain for the animals.

                                Animals in zoos, aquariums and marine parks are collections of wild animals confined in enclosures for the amusement and entertainment of the visitors. The enclosures are so small that the animals cannot to do actions that are normal to them, like running, roaming, climbing, flying, swimming with others of their own kind.  They can’t forage, choose their own mate and friends, choose their own food and so on. Animals imprisoned in these institutions suffer severely from stress brought on by captivity and confinement. <br><br>

                                Animals in zoos, aquariums and marine parks are collections of wild animals confined in enclosures for the amusement and entertainment of the visitors. The enclosures are so small that the animals cannot to do actions that are normal to them, like running, roaming, climbing, flying, swimming with others of their own kind.  They can’t forage, choose their own mate and friends, choose their own food and so on. Animals imprisoned in these institutions suffer severely from stress brought on by captivity and confinement.<br><br>

                                Whales, who in nature swim many miles every day in the ocean and dive deeply into it, also suffer from the extreme confinement of their enclosures, the marine park  tanks.  In addition, the stress of being trained to perform tricks that are unnatural to them causes anxiety and fear.  The two main forms of training are food deprivation and isolation. Captivity and isolation for these highly social animals, who, in the wild,  travel in close-knit pods all their lives and form strong bonds with their pod-mates, is severely traumatic for them.<br><br>

                                Countless marine animals have been stolen from the wild and placed in these marine “parks.” According to Last Chance for Animals, “Capturing one wild orca or dolphin disrupts the entire pod. Some try to save them, following capture boats for miles.”<br>

                                Aquariums, marine parks and zoos bill themselves as “educational,” but the main thing visitors learn is that it’s perfectly okay to keep wild animals in captivity for the entertainment of humans.<br>

                                Training elephants and other animals to entertain people at circuses means violence, beatings and other horrors for these captive animals. Most elephants used by circuses are captured in the wild; in the wild, young elephants nurse for their first five years and live in a protective environment within their family group. Circus trainers want to begin training elephants, lions, and tigers when they are still very young so that they can be “broken” more easily.   Adult elephants, chained and forced to watch a baby elephant being trained to fear and obey the trainer, become very distressed, struggling against their chains to reach the young elephant.<br>
                                These young wild animals face a dismal life of domination, confinement, and physical and psychological deprivation. Lions, tigers, and other animals used in circuses share a similar fate, forced, like the elephants, into performing unnatural and silly tricks for human “entertainment.”<br>

                                Rodeos abuse, maim and kill animals. Normally docile cows, calves and horses are physically provoked into showing “wild” behavior  to show how “stalwart and brave” the cowboys are. The bucking strap is tightly strapped around the horse’s abdomen, sometimes with a burr or other irritant under it. Electric prods and spurs are used to enrage…and terrify a horse. Videos have shown additional, apparently super powerful electric shocks given to horses who don’t want to leave the chute.<br></br>
                                Calves, roped when running, have their necks snapped back by the lasso, often resulting in neck and back injuries, broken bones and internal bleeding.<br><br>
                                Corporate sponsors, the rodeo cowboys, and all the organizers of rodeos, profit from this cruel “entertainment”</br>
                            </p>

                                Like the animals used in circuses, the lions, tigers, chimpanzees, and apes used in films and other show business are usually taken away from their mothers and family groups  as babies or youngsters so that they can be  more easily dominated and taught  to fear humans. Even so, for every performing lion or tiger,30 lions or tigers are ”destroyed” because they don’t have the looks or temperament for learning these unnatural actions.<br><br>
                                The training of animals for show business, especially of the non-domesticated animals like apes, elephants, lions… is one based on fear.  According to PETA, “Normal, healthy young apes are naturally playful, curious, energetic, and mischievous—all traits that are diametrically opposed to performing complex behaviors on cue. In order to show apes “who’s boss,” trainers “break their spirits” by beating the animals with fists, wooden sticks, rocks, or even metal rods. “<br><br>
                                The chimpanzee “grin” so often seen in movies and on TV is actually a grimace of fear.<br><br>
                                But where is the American Humane Association, you might ask. The American Humane Association does not monitor any action that happens outside the actual filming on the set. It does not monitor the
                                training or living conditions off the set, nor the disposition of unwanted animals, who are usually sold to the highest bidder which could be a cheap roadside stand or operators of canned hunts.<br></br>
                                In addition, according to “The Hollywood Reporter,” the AHA rarely even follows through to investigate injuries and deaths that do occur during filming. The American Humane Association is funded by the Screen Actors Guild and Hollywood supporters and seems to have many untoward ties to the industry it is supposed to monitor.</br>

                                    Training elephants and other animals to entertain people at circuses means violence, beatings and other horrors for these captive animals. Most elephants used by circuses are captured in the wild; in the wild, young elephants nurse for their first five years and live in a protective environment within their family group. Circus trainers want to begin training elephants, lions, and tigers when they are still very young so that they can be “broken” more easily.   Adult elephants, chained and forced to watch a baby elephant being trained to fear and obey the trainer, become very distressed, struggling against their chains to reach the young elephant.<br>
                                    These young wild animals face a dismal life of domination, confinement, and physical and psychological deprivation. Lions, tigers, and other animals used in circuses share a similar fate, forced, like the elephants, into performing unnatural and silly tricks for human “entertainment.”<br>
                                </p>

                                    Rodeos abuse, maim and kill animals. Normally docile cows, calves and horses are physically provoked into showing “wild” behavior  to show how “stalwart and brave” the cowboys are. The bucking strap is tightly strapped around the horse’s abdomen, sometimes with a burr or other irritant under it. Electric prods and spurs are used to enrage…and terrify a horse. Videos have shown additional, apparently super powerful electric shocks given to horses who don’t want to leave the chute.<br></br>
                                    Calves, roped when running, have their necks snapped back by the lasso, often resulting in neck and back injuries, broken bones and internal bleeding.<br><br>
                                    Corporate sponsors, the rodeo cowboys, and all the organizers of rodeos, profit from this cruel “entertainment”</br>
                                </p>

                                    Like the animals used in circuses, the lions, tigers, chimpanzees, and apes used in films and other show business are usually taken away from their mothers and family groups  as babies or youngsters so that they can be  more easily dominated and taught  to fear humans. Even so, for every performing lion or tiger,30 lions or tigers are ”destroyed” because they don’t have the looks or temperament for learning these unnatural actions.<br><br>
                                    The training of animals for show business, especially of the non-domesticated animals like apes, elephants, lions… is one based on fear.  According to PETA, “Normal, healthy young apes are naturally playful, curious, energetic, and mischievous—all traits that are diametrically opposed to performing complex behaviors on cue. In order to show apes “who’s boss,” trainers “break their spirits” by beating the animals with fists, wooden sticks, rocks, or even metal rods. “<br><br>
                                    The chimpanzee “grin” so often seen in movies and on TV is actually a grimace of fear.<br><br>
                                    But where is the American Humane Association, you might ask. The American Humane Association does not monitor any action that happens outside the actual filming on the set. It does not monitor the
                                    training or living conditions off the set, nor the disposition of unwanted animals, who are usually sold to the highest bidder which could be a cheap roadside stand or operators of canned hunts.<br></br>
                                    In addition, according to “The Hollywood Reporter,” the AHA rarely even follows through to investigate injuries and deaths that do occur during filming. The American Humane Association is funded by the Screen Actors Guild and Hollywood supporters and seems to have many untoward ties to the industry it is supposed to monitor.</br>
