            <h3>Animal Cruelty and Factory Farming</h3>
            <p>
            Animals raised for food in the United States endure unspeakable suffering. The days of the family farm are over, and more than 97% of the meat and dairy Americans consume comes from factory farms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Factory farming is the term used to describe the industrial process of breeding, raising, and slaughtering animals for human consumption on a mass-production scale, where profit and efficiency drive the industry practices and there is little to no regard for the welfare of the animal. Animals in the factory farming system are treated as commodities being exploited for profit with few laws to protect them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Many people don’t realize just how brutal and cruel the animal agriculture industries are, as those industries spend millions of dollars to hide the reality of what happens inside their walls. They also spend huge amounts of money on advertising campaigns to deceive the public about how the industry treats its animals.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Factory farms pack animals into spaces so tight that most can barely move. Many have no access to the outdoors, spending their lives on open warehouse floors, or in cages or pens without the room to engage in their natural behaviors. These confined animals experience severe physical and mental distress.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some of the realities of today’s animal agriculture industries:
